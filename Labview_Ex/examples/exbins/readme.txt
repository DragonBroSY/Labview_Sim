Use this directory to store the .bin3 file that LabVIEW generates when you prepare an example to appear in the NI Example Finder. The .bin3 file contains search information that the NI Example Finder uses to locate and display the associated example.

Refer to the "Preparing Example VIs to Appear in the NI Example Finder" topic under Fundamentals>>Creating VIs and SubVIs>>How-To>>Customizing VIs on the Contents tab of the LabVIEW Help for more information about including examples in the NI Example Finder.
