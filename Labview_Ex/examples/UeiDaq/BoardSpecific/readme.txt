Example explanations:

AI-248-230 PtByPt with variable Auto Zero, variable gain and disk file logging.vi

This example was created to demonstrate reading all 24 channels with Auto Zero selectable and the setting
of different gains.  A disk file is created with spreadsheet formatted data and a time record.

DIO-432 and DIO-433 Write Protected Lines PointByPoint with Circuit Breaker - 3 channel.vi

This example uses the “doline” syntax in the DO resource string to separately configure three output lines
or channels to an over-current limit.  It also demonstrates the setting of PWM mode and characteristics.
It shows reading of the Guardian current and the status of the circuit breakers.  There is the ability to
mask and instigate the circuit breaker reset and to set the status of the lines after reset.  You can also
set the delay time from over current detection to circuit breaker trip.
