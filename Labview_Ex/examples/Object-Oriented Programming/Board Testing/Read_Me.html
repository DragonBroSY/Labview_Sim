programming for a company that writes and maintains test and measurement
programs.<br>

<h3><a name="The_Goal"></a>The Testing Goal</h3>



A&nbsp;company produces computer plug-in boards. The company has three products:<br>





<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">





  <li>Basic DAQ Board</li>




  <li>Elite DAQ Board</li>




  <li>GPIB Board</li>




</ol>

The company wants to inspect each board as it comes off the assembly
line to make sure the pieces soldered to the boards are placed
correctly. A camera over each of the three assembly lines sends images to a single machine. The machine analyzes the
images and determines if the board is assembled correctly.<br>

<br>





The boards follow a standard form factor and are made up of common components: resistors, capacitors, and chips. <br>





<table style="text-align: left; width: 633px; height: 192px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">





  <tbody>




    <tr>




      <td style="width: 213px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A) Basic DAQ Board</span><br>

      <td style="width: 213px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">B) Elite DAQ Board</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">(same as Basic DAQ but with the addition of the on-board filter)</span><br>





      <img src="Board%20B.png" alt=""></td>




      <td style="width: 213px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">C) GPIB Board</span><br>





      <img src="Board%20C.png" alt="" style="width: 188px; height: 120px;"></td>




    </tr>




  
  
  
  
  </tbody>
</table>





<br>





The company needs a LabVIEW program that receives images from the
cameras, analyzes them and determines if each board is
assembled correctly.<br>





<br>





<h3><a name="Task-Oriented_Solution"></a>Task-Based Solution</h3>



In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Board Testing</span> project, open&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Test Boards_TASK.vi</span> in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Task-Oriented Solution</span> folder.<br>




<br>




This VI demonstrates a task-based approach to the&nbsp;problem posed in the previous section.<br>



<br>



Display and examine the block diagram. First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generate Test Images.vi</span>
simulates the acquisition of the images and places them in a queue.
Then, a While Loop retrieves one image at a time from the queue and
processes it.<br>



<br>



A value is paired with each image to designate the type of board it
represents. A Case structure switches on the board type and runs the
test for that board.<br>



<br>



The test results include a unique test identification string, the board type, and a pass/fail Boolean.<br>



<br>



Review the subVIs that perform the tests for the boards. They verify
the presence of blocks of certain colors at certain positions on the
board. Using shared subVIs, they reuse code for common blocks.<br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>



Overall, this is a good solution that fulfills the requested task.<br>





<h3><a name="Object-Oriented_Solution"></a>Object-Oriented Solution</h3>



In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Board Testing</span> project, open&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Test Boards_OBJECT.vi</span> in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Object-Oriented Solution</span> folder.<br>



<br>



This VI demonstrates an object-oriented approach to the problem posed in the first section.<br>



<br>



Display and examine the block diagram. The generation of simulated images and the
test results output are the same as in the task-based solution. This
demonstrates that you can rewrite a section of an application to use
LabVIEW classes without&nbsp;rewriting the entire application.<br>



<br>



The Case structure to switch off the board type is now in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enum to Board Design.vi</span> subVI that produces an object of the appropriate type.<br>



<br>



With the object-oriented approach, it is easier to see that the VI
performs the same operations (checking the image and creating a test
name) on each board.<br>



<br>



Open <span style="font-weight: bold;">Check Image Matches Design.vi</span> from the block diagram of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test Boards_OBJECT.vi</span> and display its block diagram. Note that it has a very different structure than the tests in the task-based approach.<br>



<br>



Instead of a set of checks for blocks of certain colors at certain positions, this VI gets a list of <span style="font-weight: bold;">component</span> objects from the board and calls the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Self Test</span> method on each component. <br>



<br>



The object-oriented approach encourages the developer to decompose the
problem differently than the task-based approach. The next section
reviews some of the benefits of the object-oriented approach.<br>



<h3><a name="Benefits"></a>Costs and Benefits of Object-Oriented Design</h3>





Open the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Classes</span> folder in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Object-Oriented Solution</span> folder. The object-oriented approach uses many more subVIs than the task-based approach.<br>



<br>



Each VI in the object-oriented system does a very specific task. The
VIs are therefore smaller, and more numerous, than the VIs in the
task-based approach. This approach produces code that is easier to
read, especially for developers who are new to the project and unfamiliar
with the existing VIs.<br>



<br>



But the other advantages of object-oriented programming are not necessarily seen when you first write the
code. Consider a case where you have to modify your application.<br>




<h4>Scenario: A Vendor Changes a Part</h4>



Notice that all three boards have three blue squares in a column on the
left side and a purple bar on the top row. In the task-based solution,
the the test for these four blocks is in a subVI that is common to all
three board tests. Shared code in common subVIs is good programming
practice. But what the
picture does not display is this:<br>




<br>




1 == Analog to Digital Converter<br>




2 == Digital to Analog Converter<br>






<table style="text-align: left; width: 633px; height: 192px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">






  <tbody>




    <tr>




      <td style="width: 213px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A) Basic DAQ Board</span><br>





      <img src="Labeled%20Board%20A.png" alt=""><br>




      </td>




      <td style="width: 213px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">B) Elite DAQ Board</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>





      <img src="Labeled%20Board%20B.png" alt=""><br>




      </td>




      <td style="width: 213px; vertical-align: bottom; text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">C) GPIB Board</span><br>





      <img src="Labeled%20Board%20C.png" alt=""><br>




      </td>




    </tr>




  
  
  
  
  </tbody>
</table>



<br>



In this particular situation, the A/D converters and D/A converters
happen to have identical appearances. However, the GPIB board is actually
different from the two DAQ boards, even though they look the same. <br>




<br>



Suppose a parts vendor changes the color of the A/D converters to
red. Contrast the steps required to modify the task-based and object-oriented test applications:<br>



<h5>Task-based VIs</h5>




<ul>




  <li>Duplicate <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test_Common To All Boards.vi</span>, which is currently
shared by the DAQ board test and the GPIB board. Modify one copy of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test_Common To All Boards.vi</span> to account for the new color.</li>




  <li>Find every place in all subVIs where blue is used and determine
if it should change to red or if it should stay blue. (Some of these
are for A/D converters, some are for D/A converters).<br>




  </li>




</ul>




<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h5>Object-oriented VIs</h5>




<ul>




  <li>Change the color constant in&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">AD Converter.lvclass::Self Test.vi </span>to red.</li>




</ul>




<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The modification to the object-oriented VIs is faster and provides less opportunity to introduce errors.<br>



<h3><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>



The task-oriented solution shares code in places where the problem
looks the same from a task perspective. The object-oriented solution
shares code where the objects underlying the task are the same. This
decomposition into components makes it very easy to update code when a
component changes. The behavior of that component is isolated from
the rest of the system. <br>




<br>



Consider these scenarios:<br>




<ul>




  <li>If the company makes a new board, how difficult is it to add that board to
the test system for the task-based solution vs. the object-oriented
solution? <br>




  </li>




  <li>If the company changes a board design to rotate one of the
components, which of the two implementations would have
fewer changes? (Note that the object-oriented system, because it
handles components as objects, already supports rotation of a
component).</li>




</ul>



In summary, the
value of object-oriented design is not always apparent in
the first version of an application (although code readability and organization are
certainly valuable). But the benefits of easier and more robust code modification become clear with each revision.<br>
