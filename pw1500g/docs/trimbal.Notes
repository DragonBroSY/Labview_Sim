Fan plane has a weight tang every 2 blades, i.e. 18 weight locations for 36 blades.

Turbine weights are installed by referencing the Fan (rather than have to count a 
	zillion turbine blades)
	
So, this is why the turbine weight locations are the same number of fan BLADES, not
	fan weight locations.
